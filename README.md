# Pixel Art Maker 2
This is a lab submission for Phase 2 of the Grow with Google Scholarship Program, which is Udacity's Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program. I have to create a desktop app where the user can enter dimensions to build a canvas, consisting of a grid of squares. The user can then create art by coloring in the squares, using their color of choice. I was given starter HTML and CSS code. The test is to code the JavaScript file and demonstrate my skills in working with the DOM, using document object methods and event listeners.
